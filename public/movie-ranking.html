<h1>Adam's list of "hell ya! flicks"</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Austin Powers: The Spy who shagged me</h3>
<p>Slapstick humor at its best. You gotta love Meyer's acting in this - although many would disagree.</p>
<h3>The Mummy</h3>
<p>Never gets old. Great acting and lots of imagination.</p>
<h3>Platoon</h3>
<p>This one feeds the soldier in me.</p>
