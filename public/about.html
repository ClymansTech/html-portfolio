<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I will do my best here as I always seem to struggle with "about me's". I enjoy many things in life which has lead me down a very diverse path jobwise and as well as in the education dept., I'm all over the place but to me this is the spice of life. The journey to a higher understanding of everything that is using the Curious George method. Wow, that covers it I guess. I'm an adventurist. Similar to the parts of the plant kindom, I require water and a mix of direct and indirect sunlight and a not so heavy feed cycle. I'm also kinda like a mushroom where I hide during the rain but afterwards I come out to play.

<p>My hobbies and likes include basically anything outdoors but also sciences. I have an affinity to nature and sciences. I explore when and where I can. I explore books, the internet, and of course  the great outdoors. I enjoy fishing and kayaking, hunting and camping. I relish coding which is what I am doing to write this very sentence so you can read it on the internet. Growing organic anything is so much fun to me. I have five freerange chickens that give me beautiful multi-coloured eggs everyday. Most of all though, I love my dog Rocky. My best friend who's been there through thick and thin with me which is more than I can say about 99% of the people in my life. When I was sick he would wake me up from seizures. When I was unconcious he would lead people to me for assistance. He is one hundred pounds of pure German Shephard awesome!</p>

<p>An odd thing about me...I'm a home body that loves to travel. So, if I'm not working on my little homestead then you can find me travelling the globe.</p>
